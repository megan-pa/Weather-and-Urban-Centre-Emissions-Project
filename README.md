# Weather and Urban Centre Emissions 

## Overview
This project investigates the MET Office subset of the WeatherBench dataset that contains information on climate factors (precipitation, u-wind, v-wind and temperature) for 12 locations worldwide. 

## Datasets 
### Initial Datasets
For this research, multiple datasets have been combined to investigate links between climate, socioeconomic factors and natural disasters. Below are links to the datasets used for this analysis: 
* [Applied Data Science - Met Office Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10624903)
* [Emergency Events Database(EM-DAT)](https://public.emdat.be/)
* [Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) Dataset](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/geocoded-disasters-gdis-dataset)
* [Global Human Settlement Layer - Urban Centre Database (GHSL UCDB)](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/ucdb2024Overview.php)
* [WHO Disease Dataset](https://www.who.int/data)

### Final Dataset
Our final merged dataset combined disaster, climate and socioeconomic data into a unified dataset. This included 16 features relating to environmental and development indicators and was used for our data modelling section. Further details on how this dataset was created can be found in the report.
